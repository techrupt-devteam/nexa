	<p>How do you keep your favourite car in the same shape, just the way it was created? How do you keep it 100% NEXA , from the smallest nut to an all-important axle? In your NEXA , over 20,000 parts come together and work in perfect harmony. Each part is factory-fitted, conforming to our quality standards. In due course, wear and tear and consequent replacement and repair happen. NEXA Genuine Parts ensure that your car remains like the original, down to the smallest part. We have a huge network of NEXA  dealers and NEXA  service stations across the nation, there to help you with genuine spare parts.</p>

<p>Each part is checked for quality, re-checked and then checked once more. Only then will our engineers clear a part for sale to you. In fact, we often conduct quality inspections at our vendor units also. All to ensure that you get parts just like the original. Whether you are buying a new NEXA  car or a used car, the quality standards are always met. NEXA Genuine Parts are easily available through our nationwide network of dealer workshops, service stations, NEXA Genuine Parts distributors and retail outlets at reasonable prices, which further adds to the joy of owning and driving a NEXA .</p>
